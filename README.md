# Artos Coding Assessment - Informed Consent Form Generation

This is a coding assessment from the startup Artos.ai. The purpose of this coding assessment is to build a web application that can generate Informed Consent Forms (ICF) based off of a collection of clinical trial documents.

## Background

There are lots of documents that go into running a clinical trial. Clinical protocols are one of the most important. A protocol contains detailed information on how the study is going to be run, including info on key study details like trial design, inclusion/exclusion criteria for patients, and study endpoints/objectives. You can find examples of a clinical trial protocol on the [clinicaltrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov) database.

However, protocols are just one of the many documents that are required to run a clinical trial. You can find more information on the rest of the documentation required for clinical trials [here](https://ccts.osu.edu/content/regulatory-documents). 

One other key document is an Informed Consent Form (ICF). This form is meant to inform participants of a clinical trial about the objectives, risks, and potential benefits of participating in the trial and is required in any clinical trial involving human subjects. Typically, ICFs are written in layman’s terms – they should be easily understood by someone with an 8th grade reading level.  You can also find ICFs on the [clinicaltrials.gov](http://clinicaltrials.gov) database.

## Task

Your task will be to generate an Informed Consent Form (ICF) given a clinical trial protocol. You will build a web application that will allow a user to:

1. Upload any clinical trial protocol
2. Generate an Informed Consent Form
3. Download this Informed Consent Form as a .docx file

Much of an ICF is already templated out – you don’t need to generate every section. We’re most interested in sections related to: 

* Purpose of the Study
* Study Procedures
    * Include number of patients and duration of the study
* Risks
* Benefits

## Resources

You may choose to use any resources at your disposal. Here are just a few that we’ve found helpful – they do not cover everything you’ll need to complete the task. You can complete this task in any language. Use your own API keys for this task. We will reimburse you if there are any costs associated with the project.

* Retrieval Augmented Generation
* Prompt Engineering & Orchestration
* Models
* Vector Databases
* Building a Web App
